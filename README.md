# Example Gift Card

Many small businesses have taken a hit due to the COVID-19 outbreak. One way to help support local businesses is purchasing gift cards.

The problem is that many modern POS systems don't either have a straight forward way to sell gift cards online or don't offer such solution at all.

This example application attempts to solve this problem by using Stripe payment solution and GiftUp API to create a easy to use online solution for selling and redeeming gift cards.

## To Run
Download the `gift-card-app` binary and run it like so:
```
 NAME=BUSINESSNAME SITEID=64756a71-b216-4da0-b16a-c8becfcf7a22 PORT=3000 ./gift-card-app 
 ```

## Environment Variables
1. Name - Name of your business
2. Site ID - site ID generated by GiftUp
3. Port - port number you wish to run the app on e.g. if you don't provide a PORT number just go to http://localhost:8090
