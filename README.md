# Example Gift Card

Many small businesses have taken a hit due to the COVID-19 outbreak. One way to help support local businesses is purchasing gift cards.

The problem is that many modern POS systems don't either have a straight forward way to sell gift cards online or don't offer such solution at all.

This example application attempts to solve this problem by using Stripe payment solution and GiftUp API to create a easy to use online solution for selling and redeeming gift cards.

2. Sign up on giftupapp.com and following the getting started steps e.g. providing stripe keys
